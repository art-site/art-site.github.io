			Exhibitions and conferences involve different types of input and fulfill different functions for the organisations taking part in them. For example, exhibitions tend to be marketing-driven and entrepreneurial in approach, while conferences have traditionally been knowledge-driven and more conservative. Only in recent years have conferences started to incorporate the showier multidimensional techniques of exhibitions.
			The different ways they disseminate information are important:
			An exhibition is an event, or marketplace, where one or more sellers display their goods and services to a group of buyers.
			A conference is a meeting with an organised agenda for delegates who have common education, communication or networking objectives.
			Exhibitions can be classified into two general types: trade exhibitions and consumer exhibitions
